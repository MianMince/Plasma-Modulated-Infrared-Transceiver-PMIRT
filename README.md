# Plasma-Modulated-Infrared-Transceiver-PMIR-
The Plasma-Modulated Infrared Transceiver (PMIRT) consists of a controlled corona discharge region placed between a Samsung TV remote and a VS1838B IR receiver. By adjusting electrode separation, the ionization intensity will vary, allowing the effect on the decoded IR signal to be measured.
